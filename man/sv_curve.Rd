\title{Seats-votes curve fitting}
\usage{
sv_curve(x, intercept, slope, model = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of vote proportions at which to evaluate the curve}

\item{intercept}{The intercept at 50-50 votes. The deviation from 50
percent is also referred to as bias.}

\item{slope}{The slope on the log odds scale. Also referred to as
responsiveness.}

\item{model}{An OLS model with log odds as the y and x variables. The
first coefficient is used as the intercept and the second as the slope.
If provided, \code{intercept} and \code{slope} are ignored.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of seat proportions
}
\description{
Evaluate a seats-votes curve at given vote shares, using a log-odds
(logit) transformation parameterized by bias (intercept) and
responsiveness (slope).
}
\examples{
votes <- seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.05)
seats_mj <- sv_curve(votes, intercept = 0, slope = 3)
seats_PR <- sv_curve(votes, intercept = 0, slope = 1)

if (requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  library(ggplot2)
  sv_df <- data.frame(votes = votes, seats_PR = seats_PR, seats_mj = seats_mj)
  ggplot(sv_df, aes(x = votes)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = seats_PR), color = "navy") +
    geom_line(aes(y = seats_mj), color = "forestgreen") +
    coord_equal(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
    labs(x = "Votes", y = "Seats")
